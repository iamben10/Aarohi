AAROHI BOT - QUOTE COMMAND FIX
================================

ISSUE:
- The !quote command was sending multiple messages instead of a single consolidated response
- This made the output cluttered and confusing for users

SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
1. Created a new implementation of the quote command in the standalone_bot.py file
2. The new implementation consolidates ALL output into a single embed message
3. Created a RUN_FIXED_QUOTES.bat file to easily start the bot with the fixed command

HOW IT WORKS:
- The new quote command uses Discord's embed system for clean, attractive formatting
- All information (quote, author, categories) is included in ONE message
- Category selection works the same way as before:
  * !quote            → Random quote from any category
  * !quote motivation → Quote from the motivation category
  * !quote success    → Quote from the success category
  * !quote focus      → Quote from the focus category

HOW TO USE:
1. Double-click on RUN_FIXED_QUOTES.bat to start the bot
2. Use the !quote command in Discord as usual
3. Enjoy a clean, single-message response!

This fix preserves all functionality while solving the multiple message problem.
The standalone bot also includes the !guide command for a clean help display.
