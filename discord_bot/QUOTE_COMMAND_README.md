# Aarohi Bot - Fixed Quote Command

This fix addresses the issue where the `!quote` command was sending multiple messages instead of consolidating everything into one clean output.

## How to Use the Fixed Quote Command

1. Run the bot by double-clicking on the `RUN_FIXED_QUOTES.bat` file.
2. In Discord, you can use the command in two ways:
   - `!quote` - Gets a random inspirational quote
   - `!quote [category]` - Gets a quote from a specific category (motivation, success, focus)

## Features of the Fixed Quote Command

- âœ… **Single Message Output**: The bot now sends only ONE message per command execution.
- ðŸ”„ **Category Selection**: You can specify categories like `motivation`, `success`, or `focus`.
- ðŸ“‹ **Category List**: If you use an invalid category or none at all, the bot will show available categories.
- ðŸŽ¨ **Clean Embed**: Quotes are displayed in a clean, attractive embed with proper attribution.

## Technical Changes Made

The fix was implemented by:

1. Adding a completely new `quote` command to the standalone bot that consolidates all messages into a single response.
2. Using Discord embeds to format the quote beautifully.
3. Including proper error handling and category suggestions in a single message.

## Example Output

When you type `!quote motivation`, you'll get a single message that contains:
```
[Motivation Quote]
"Believe you can and you're halfway there."
â€” Theodore Roosevelt
```

When you type just `!quote` or an invalid category, you'll get:
```
[Inspirational Quote]
"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts."
â€” Winston Churchill

Available Categories: Try: `motivation`, `success`, `focus`
```

All in a single, clean message!
